        <p>Hello, My name is Cydney. I am 15 years old. I live in New York City. I am in a coding program called Script Ed. that teaches me how to use CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I am in the Advanced Class, where I will travel to a tech company, where I will have the oppurtunity to see how a tech company looks and works, and learn more advanced coding skills. I really enjoy learning code with Script-Ed, and hope to pursue a career in computer development, or computer programming. To learn more abot the program that I attend, click the link below. <a href= "https://scripted.org/" More about Script Ed.></a></a></p>
